# Credit Card Fraud Detection using ML

### Overview:
The challenge in this project is to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions to prevent customers from being charged for items they did not purchase. Credit card fraud detection involves processing enormous amounts of data daily and building models that can respond quickly to scams. 

### Before Starting:
- Use Jupyter Notebook for the project.
- If not installed, use Google Colab.
- Dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle.

Let's dive into the code to develop a credit card fraud detection model!
